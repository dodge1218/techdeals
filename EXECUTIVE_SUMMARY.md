## ARCHITECTURE HIGHLIGHTS

### Tech Stack
```
Frontend:  Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
Backend:   Next.js API Routes (serverless-ready)
Database:  Prisma ORM (SQLite dev, PostgreSQL prod)
Jobs:      BullMQ + Redis (graceful degradation if Redis down)
Search:    BM25 algorithm (upgrade path to vectors defined)
LLM:       Provider-agnostic (mock → OpenAI/Anthropic/Llama)
Deploy:    Docker + Vercel/Fly.io ready
CI/CD:     GitHub Actions (lint, build, test)
```

### Anti-Looper Design Philosophy
```
✅ Ship mocks immediately → No API key blockers
✅ Clear upgrade paths → Drop-in real implementations
✅ Graceful degradation → Works without Redis/external APIs
✅ Zero technical debt → Production patterns from day 1
```
